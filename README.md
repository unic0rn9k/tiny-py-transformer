# tiny-py-transformer
Small transformer implementation using pytorch

Everyone kept punking me about learning python and pytorch,
so here is a proof of concept transformer implementation...

## Thanks a lot to...
[Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy), for making a [video where he implements transformers with pytorch](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). And for publishing his code in [a git repo](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture).

For making sure I really understood all the concepts in the video, I made sure not to write anything off (expect the code in data.py). Instead I opted to watch segments of the video, then trying to implement it on my own, to make sure I really absorbed all the concepts.
